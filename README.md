## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux operating system (or WSL on Windows)
- GCC compiler
- Basic knowledge of C programming

### Compilation
Most C programs can be compiled using:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

For programs using threads:
```bash
gcc filename.c -pthread -o output
./output
```

## 📝 Key Topics Covered

### Process Management
- Fork, exec, wait system calls

- Thread creation and joining
- Mutex locks and semaphores
- Race conditions and deadlock prevention

### Inter-Process Communication
- Pipes and named pipes
- Message queues
- Shared memory
- Signals

### System Calls
- File operations (open, read, write, close)
- Process control (fork, exec, wait)
- Memory management
